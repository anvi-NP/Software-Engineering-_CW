3. Specification
McGregor Institute of Botanical Training is Ireland based training institute located

at Godawari, Lalitpur. It has been almost 7 years since they have been operating

in Nepal. It provides different undergraduate and postgraduate courses
specializing in agriculture along with horticulture specializations and is affiliated to
Dublin City University. Recently, with the sudden surge in the number of people
with interest in the domain of agriculture, they are planning to introduce a range of
short term certification courses related to horticulture for anyone interested.
Apart from the certification courses, they are looking forward to selling different
varieties of plants charging a minimal fee and for free in some of the cases. They
want to build a community of individuals with interests in plants and want to create
a platform(forum) where the plant enthusiasts can discuss their ideas, organize
programs to protect rare plants and forests. The forum can also prove to be a
platform where people can post their queries to be answered by the experts.
