1. Introduction
This assignment contributes 35% to the overall mark for this module.
<br>
2. Specification
   <br>
McGregor Institute of Botanical Training is Ireland based training institute located
at Godawari, Lalitpur. It has been almost 7 years since they have been operating
in Nepal. It provides different undergraduate and postgraduate courses
specializing in agriculture along with horticulture specializations and is affiliated to
Dublin City University. Recently, with the sudden surge in the number of people
with interest in the domain of agriculture, they are planning to introduce a range of
short term certification courses related to horticulture for anyone interested.
Apart from the certification courses, they are looking forward to selling different
varieties of plants charging a minimal fee and for free in some of the cases. They
want to build a community of individuals with interests in plants and want to create
a platform(forum) where the plant enthusiasts can discuss their ideas, organize
programs to protect rare plants and forests. The forum can also prove to be a
platform where people can post their queries to be answered by the experts.

3. Detailed Specification
   <br>
The proposed system is to have following functions
<br>

1. Register in the system.
Any new user should be registered in the system to use the features in the
system.
<br>

2. Join the program.
Anyone interested can join the program. i.e graduate or postgraduate or
certificate oriented short courses. Courses are both paid and unpaid.
<br>

3. Purchase plants
The provision for users to view varieties of plants and purchase if interested.
<br>

4. Payment
There should be a provision for the customer to pay and for the plant
purchased and the course they are enrolled in. Data of the payment should
be stored.
<br>

5. Ask for recommendations.
The provision to ask for recommendations with experts. Users pinpoint their
site location in the map, if possible, soil condition images and experts reply
with the suitable plants/crops that can be planted in that particular location.
<br>

6. Report preparation.
The facility for the admin to prepare a detailed financial report, employees
report and report related to every user.

8. Take certification exams.
Users can take mock tests as per their convenience, check results and also
give certification exams after fulfilling certain prerequisites.

10. Forum
Users can engage in conversations about plants, sharing their opinions
through posts. They can also comment on and upvote others' opinions.

Planning, requirements modeling and analysis (65%)
1. Prepare a Work Breakdown Structure demonstrating the possible scope of
the proposed system. And prepare a Gantt Chart indicating how you might
schedule the work of developing the system. But please ensure that the
Gantt chart is based upon a methodology of your choice and the
activities/tasks should be relevant to the methodology chosen.

2. Produce a Use Case Model for the required system â€“ including a Use Case
diagram, and High-Level Use Case Descriptions for each Use Case. For
two of the Use Cases of your choice, produce Expanded Use Case
Descriptions.

Choose one of these expanded Use Case Descriptions to model both the
Collaboration and Sequence diagram, in 3, below.

4. Explain in words how you would go about producing the Communication
diagrams, that is a Collaboration diagram and a Sequence diagram, from
the Use Case model.

Produce a Collaboration diagram and then produce a Sequence diagram
for the same Use Case.

5. Prepare a table comprising all possible domain classes from all the
respective use cases. Produce an Analysis Class diagram showing the
domain classes. 

Design (35%)

1. You have done several tasks till date (analysis and design diagrams have
been done). Now how do you plan to move further in the process of
completing the project? You are required to select a methodology that you
think is feasible for this project and your explanation of further planning
should be relatable to the methodology that you have chosen.

(Note: the further planning should compulsorily include following
things:

1) Architectural choice.
2) Design Pattern.
3) Development Plan (that includes tools/resources/programming
platforms that are going to be used and priority order of
artifacts/features that you have planned tentatively.
4) Testing Plan.
5) Maintenance Plan.
   
2. Develop some design prototypes for the proposed system for features
which are listed in detailed specification.

(Note: the prototypes should cover the major features and at least 15
separate prototypes need to be shown.)
